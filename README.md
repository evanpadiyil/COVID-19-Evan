# COVID-19-Evan

### Introduction
High level introduction of the project

Following the COVID-19 outbreak, I was stuck at home with nothing to do. I wanted to be of help so I created this COVID data map using D3.js to show how each country has been affected by the coronavirus. For starters, the map shows the amount of people infected and people dead in each country. I plan on putting even more information soon, such as how the economy was hit and dates when lockdowns were put into effect.
