# COVID-19-Evan

### Introduction
Following the COVID-19 outbreak, I was stuck at home with nothing to do. I wanted to be of help so I created this COVID data map using D3.js to show how each country has been affected by the coronavirus. For starters, the map shows the amount of people infected and people dead in each country. I plan on putting even more information soon, such as how the economy was hit and dates when lockdowns were put into effect.

### Code Organization
In the repository, there are multiple files. The LICENSE holds the MIT License that I am using for this project. The README is this file, which helps you understand the project. copy.html and something.html are htmls that I am currently using to create a table so that my two maps can be side to side instead of having to scroll down. Soon, they will be removed and I will put their code into index.html. Index.html is where all my code for my map stays. For now, it shows how many people have been infected and died in each country. I update it regularly so that the numbers are always up-to-date. Covid-cases.csv holds the information on how many people have become infected in each country and covid-cases0.csv holds the number of people who have died in each country. Soon, the will be automatically updated whenever I change the file out in an s3 bucket.
